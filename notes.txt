# board layout will be a list with codes relating to tiles and ints for number of blank tiles

Levels will be saved as text files
    - The file will contain 'Codes' which correspond to tile type and blank spaces
    - An example Level file may look like:
    - level file will need other information about the map as well as the layout, maybe the map files will be json
            or and actual python object with data structure for layout and key spawns

            ww, ww, ww, W, W, ww, ww, ww, ww, ww
            ww, x, x, x, x, x, x, x, C, ww
            ww, x, x, x, T, ww, ww, ww, ww, ww
            ww, x, x, x, T, x, x, x, F, ww

    -These codes will be fed into a factory function that will instantiate the appropriate object and append them to a list
    -The values of these objects will be used to create the board display .contents = [x]
    -drawing the board will be joining a list that is the objects contents/string values

    A  B  C  D  E  F  G  H  I  J  K  L  M  N
1  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
2  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
3  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
4  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
5  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
6  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
7  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]
8  [ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ][ ]

# tile = "[ ]"
# print(tile*20)

Would like the board to be read from a file, line by line and
joined together with newline chars to create the board display.

Level links will just load in a different level file.
Levels can be zipped into an archive to further save space.
unzip and read the text file and then delete it once finished to clean up memory

Statistics Class that holds all stats and gets called when any recordable action happens,
this will get pickled and saved/loaded for persistent stats on a save file.

Save file will be a class that upon exiting game it will be populated with all required objects.
Game object
Current Player state
Current Level
Statistics
This object will be serialized and saved and can be loaded and 'unpacked'
